## Description
This is a web application that facilitates currency conversion between various currencies. Our app is designed to help users convert currency amounts effortlessly.

With our app, users can easily enter the amount they wish to convert in a specific currency, select the two currencies for conversion, and initiate the conversion by clicking on a button. The app will display the converted amount along with the current time for the two selected currencies.

In addition, our application also provides the Big Mac price of the selected currencies, enabling us to have a better understanding of the cost of living in different countries.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
